# Important changes from previous courses
> 
> * * *
> 
> This iteration of the Machine Learning Foundations course includes several changes that we believe will provide students with a more valuable learning experience and a more valuable set of tools going forward. The two biggest changes are:
> 
> *   **Moving from Graphlab Create to Turi Create**: Graphlab is being replaced by Turi Create. Changing to this new library ensures continued technical support for the library. Additionally, unlike Graphlab which required students to obtain a temporary license, Turi Create is **open-source**, meaning that you will be able to continue using Turi Create even after finishing the course.
> *   **Moving from Python 2 to Python 3:** On January 1st of 2020, Python 2 will be retired. Therefore, we are shifting the course to use the more modern Python 3.
> 
> ### What this means for you as a student
> 
> We are working hard to update all course resources for these changes. However, you may see videos with coding examples that reference Python 2 syntax or Graphlab Create instead of Turi Create. In these instances, we will include annotations to inform you of the updated content. In almost all scenarios, the Python 2/Graphlab syntax will be identical to the Python 3/Turi Create syntax. The biggest difference you may notice is that printing in Python now requires parenthesis:

> print "hello, world!"
> 
> # Python 3
> 
> print("hello, world!")
> 
> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
> 
> </pre>
> 
> We hope that these changes will make this course even more valuable, and prepare you to use a set of tools that more closely align with the industry standards.
