> *   You will also need this dataset: [people-example.csv](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/phoenixassets/course1-for-students/people-example.csv)
> *   Save all these files in the same directory (where you are calling Jupyter notebook from), and open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook. **Not sure where to save the files? See** [**this guide**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/supplement/kRD6B/where-should-my-files-go)**.**
> *   Note that this is the same notebook used in the readings for this module.
> 
> **Note:** You will notice that in the video Carlos uses GraphLab, while in the notebook we use Turi Create. This will happen a lot during the course. The syntax in the two packages is almost identical, but when there are minor differences, we recommend you to follow the code in the notebook.
