## Numpy tutorial

*****

**About Numpy.  **Matrix operations are a significant part of the inner loop of
the algorithms we will implement in this module and subsequent modules.  To
speed up your code, it can be important to use a specialized matrix operations
library. There are many such libraries out there.  In Python, we recommend
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), a popular open-source package for this task.

**Numpy tutorial.  **To help you get started with Numpy, we've created a simple
tutorial that goes over all the Numpy operations you will need for this course:

numpy-tutorial.ipynb.zip

We strongly recommend you go over this tutorial, before going any further.  

**More information on Numpy**, beyond this tutorial, can be found in the [Numpy
getting started
guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/quickstart.html). 

**Installing Numpy.  **If you installed Turi Create, you should already have
Numpy. Otherwise, please [follow these instructions to install
it](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html).
