> 
> **Using your Slope and Intercept from predicting prices from square feet, what is the predicted price for a house with 2650 sqft? Use American-style decimals without comma separators (e.g. 300000.34), and round your answer to 2 decimal places. Do not include the dollar sign. You do not need to round your answer.**
