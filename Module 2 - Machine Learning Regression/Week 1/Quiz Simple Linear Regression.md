> Question 3
> 
> Two people present you with fits of their simple regression model for predicting house prices from square feet. You discover that the estimated intercept and slopes are exactly the same. This necessarily implies that these two people fit their models on _exactly_ the same data set.

> Question 4
> 
> You have a data set consisting of the sales prices of houses in your neighborhood, with each sale time-stamped by the month and year in which the house sold. You want to predict the average value of houses in your neighborhood over time, so you fit a simple regression model with average house price as the output and the time index (in months) as the input. Based on 10 months of data, the estimated intercept is $4569 and the estimated slope is 143 ($/month). If you extrapolate this trend forward in time, at which time index (in months) do you predict that your neighborhood's value will have doubled **relative to the value at month (index) 10**? (Assume months are 0-indexed, round to the nearest month).

> Question 5
> 
> Your friend in the U.S. gives you a simple regression fit for predicting house prices from square feet. The estimated intercept is -44850 and the estimated slope is 280.76\. You believe that your housing market behaves very similarly, but houses are measured in square meters. To make predictions for inputs in square meters, what **intercept** must you use? Hint: there are 0.092903 square meters in 1 square foot. You do not need to round your answer.
